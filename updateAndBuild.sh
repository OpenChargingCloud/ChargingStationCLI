# Two things are not fetched here and are done once, by hand, in a fresh
# clone. The OCPP charge point and charging station projects keep their
# stylesheets as SCSS and their compiled CSS out of git, so those have to be
# generated before anything referencing them compiles - it needs sass and jq on
# the PATH:
#
#   for f in libs/WWCP_OCPP/*/compileSASS.sh; do bash "$f"; done
#
# And the ISO 15118 schemas are in none of these repositories, because that is
# a licence you accept yourself:
#
#   bash libs/WWCP_ISO15118/tools/download-schemas.sh
